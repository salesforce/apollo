# Apollo Delphinius
The Apollo Delphinius project is a multi-tenant, distibuted system platform. Apollo provides a secure communications overlay using Fireflies.  The consensus layer is supplied by an asynchronous bft consensus protocol. The sql state interface is via JDBC connectable over replicated SQL state machines, supported by checkpointed CHOAM linear logs. Identity and key managment is provided as a foundational service.

The target service goal is a multitenant Zanzibar/KERI integration that provides a wide area replicated, low latency service for managing identity, key management, access control and verifiable credentials such as JWT issuance and validation.

## Build Status
![Build Status](https://github.com/salesforce/apollo/actions/workflows/maven.yml/badge.svg)

The Java Maven CI is now integrated, and given how weak these CI daemons are, this should guarantee reproducible clean builds from the command line maven.

## Requirements
Apollo requires the JDK 17+ and [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) 3.8.1 and above

## Some Features
* Compact, self contained Crypto and Utility module - Self certifying, self describing Digests, Signatures and Identifiers as well as a generous sampling of solid Bloomfilters n cousins.
* Stereotomy - Decentralized Identifier based foundation and key managment infrastructure, based on the [Key Event Receipt Infrastructure](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/keri) (KERI).
* MTLS network communication - Can use KERI for certificate authentication and generation.  Local communication simulation, also, for simplified multinode simulation for single process (IDE) testing
* Multi instance GRPC service routing - Context keyed services and routing framework
* [Fireflies](https://ymsir.com/papers/fireflies-tocs.pdf) - byzantine tolerant secure membership and communications overlay
* Reliable Broadcast - garbage collected, context routed reliable broadcast
* Ethereal: [Aleph BFT Consensus](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.05156.pdf) - Efficient atomic broacast in asynchronous networks with byzantine nodes
* CHOAM - dynamic, committee based, transaction causal ordering service producing linear logs - Replicated State Machines, built on Ethereal.
* SQL State - JDBC accessible, SQL store backed, materialized view evolved from CHOAM linear logs.  Supports DDL, DML, stored procedures, functions and triggers.
* Delphinius - Google Zanzibar clone. Provides Relation Based Access Control hosted on CHOAM SQL state machines.

## Protobuf and GRPC
Apollo uses Protobuf for all serialization and GRPC for all interprocess communication.  This implies code generation.  Not something I adore, but not much choice in the matter.

## JOOQ
Apollo makes use of [JOOQ](https://www.jooq.org) as a SQL DSL for Java. This also implies code generation and, again, not something I adore, but...

## Not A Coin Platform(tm)
Apollo isn't designed for coins, rather as essentially a distributed database.  Of course the systems of Apollo can be used for such, the design goals are much different.  Thus, no coins for you.


## WIP
Note that Apollo Delphinius is very much a _work in progress_.  There is not yet an official release.  Thus, it is by no means a full featured, hardened distributed ledger platform.

## Requirements
Apollo is a pure Java application  The build system uses Maven, and requires Maven 3.8.1+.  The Maven enforcer plugin enforces dependency convergance and Apollo is built using Java 17.

Apollo is a [multi module Maven project](https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-multiple-modules.html).  This means that the various modules of Apollo are built and versioned as a whole, rather than being seperated out into individual repositories.  This also means that modules refer to other modules within the project as dependencies, and consequently must be built in the correct order.  Note that Maven does this by default, so there should be no issues.  However, it does mean that you can't simply cd into a module and build it without building its dependencies first.


## Building
To build Apollo, cd to the root directory of the repository and then do:
   
    mvn clean install

Note that the  _install_  maven goal is **required**, as this installs the modules in your local repository for use by dependent modules within the rest of the build.  You must have invoked maven on the Apollo project root with the "install" goal at least once, to correctly build any arbitrary submodule.

## Code Generation In Apollo
Apollo requires code generation as part of the build.  This is done in the Maven "generate-sources" phase of the build.  Consequently, this build phase *must* be run at least once in order to generate the java sources required by the rest of the build.

The current code generators used in Apollo are GRPC/Proto and JOOQ.  GRPC is for the various serializable forms and network protocols used by Apollo.  The JOOQ code generation is for the JOOQ SQL functionality.

Code generation is output into the <module dir>/target/generated-sources directory.  For GRPC/Proto, there are 2 directory roots: "<module dir>/target/generated-sources/protobuf/grpc-java" and "<module dir>/target/generated-sources/protobuf/java".  For JOOQ, the root directory is "<module dir>/target/generated-sources/jooq".

Again, I stress that because these generated source directories are under the "<module dir>/target" directory, they are removed during the "clean" phase of Maven and consequently must be regenerated in order to compile the rest of the build.

Note that adding these generated source directories to the compile path is automatically taken care of in the Maven *pom.xml* in the "build-helper" plugin.

## IDE Integration
Because of the code generation requirements (really, I can't do jack about them, so complaining is silly), this can cause interesting issues with your IDE if you import Apollo.  I work with Eclipse, and things are relatively good with the current releases. However, there are many known gotchas that I literally don't know how to resolve sometimes in Eclipse Maven integration, and I have no idea about IntellJ or Visual Code, so you're on your own there.

What I recommend is first building from the command line with -DskipTests - i.e "mvn clean install -DskipTests".  This will ensure all dependencies are downloaded and all the code generation is complete.

After you do this, you shouldn't have any issue *if* your IDE Maven integration knows about and takes care of using the build-helper plugin to manage compilation directories for the module in the IDE.  However....

Myself, I find that I have to first select the top level Apollo.app module, and then Menu -> Run As -> Maven generate sources.  This *should* generate all the sources required for every submodule, so...  But I have often found that - due to some oddness of Maven and/or Eclipse - that this is insufficient.  Worse, sometimes on import into the IDE, the build-helper is (randomly) ignored and the generated source directories are not added to the module's compilation path.  So, you have to do it manually.  which requires that "mvn generate-sources" has been run...  So.....  Apologies.  Wish it wasn't this complex, but it is what it is, and no, Gradle won't solve this problem and I am not going to convert the Apollo build to it anyways, so apologies.

Feel free to generate issues and such and I will look into it as I do want this to be flawless and a good experience.  I know that's impossible, but it undoubtedly can be made better, and PRs are of course a thing.

## Metrics
Apollo uses Dropwizard Metrics and these are available for Fireflies, Reliable Broadcast, Ethereal and CHOAM.

## Testing
By default, the build uses a reduced number of simulated clients for testing.  To enable the larger test suite, use the system property "large_tests".  For example

    mvn clean install -Dlarge_tests=true

This requires a decent amount of resources, using two orders of magnitude more simulated clients in the tests, with longer serial transaction chains per transactioneer client.  This runs fine on my Apple M1max, but this is a beefy machine.  YMMV.

## Current Status
Currently, the system is in devlopment.  Fundamental identity and digest/signature/pubKey encodings has been integrated.  Apollo is now using Aleph-BFT instead of Avalanche for consensus, in the form of the Ethereal module.  CHOAM has now replaced Consortium, and the SQL replicated state machine now uses CHOAM for it's linear log and transaction model.

Simple Model stand in for multitenant shards is in place and being worked upon currently.  This integrates Stereotomy and Delphinius using CHOAM.  An E2E test of the ReBAC Delphinius service is now being tested.  Full integration of Nodes using Fireflies discovery is also tested and working.
