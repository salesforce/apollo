# Apollo Ethereal
The Ethereal Module contains the Ethereal processor

## Linear Consensus with Causal Transaction Ordering
Ethereal is based on the design in the most excellent paper [Aleph: Efficient Atomic Broadcast in Asynchronous Networks with Byzantine Nodes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.05156).

The Ethereal code base was initially derived from the Aleph Zero Foundation's proof of concept code in Golang, [consensus-go](https://github.com/aleph-zero-foundation/consensus-go).
