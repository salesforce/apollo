# Apollo Functional Testing

Minimal bare bones smoke testing of the Apollo Web artifact, run in a seperate process as "Bob" intended.

## Status

Testing is minimal and Full MTLS testing is in progress.  The current process test simply sees if it will come up without error.  The MTLS testing work will ensure that the MTLS Netty functionality is also working properly.
