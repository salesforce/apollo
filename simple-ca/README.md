# Simple CA

This is a bare bones, proof of concept only central certificate authority.  This code base is slightly modified from [Olivier Lemasle's Java Certificate Authority code base](https://github.com/olivierlemasle/java-certificate-authority) that uses the PKIX library from Bouncy Castle.

## Status

Very simple and bare boned.  Fixed key Algoritm (RSA) and fixed Keylength(2048).  Again, POC quality only.
