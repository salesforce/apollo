# Slush

This is merely a legacy module that I used to sketch out implementations of the Avalanche Slush, Snowflake and Snowball protocols.  The jump from Snowball to Avalanche is quite large, and requires a decent amount of supporting infrastructure even to begin to mock up.

## Status
Legacy.  Just enough for me to understand things, not maintained.
