/**
 * A comparator for Bloom Clock stamped with monotonically increasing values.
 * Because the Bloom Clock is a probabalistic data structure, this comparator
 * requires a provided <b>false positive rate</b> (FPR). This FPR applies when
 * clock A is compared to clock B and the determination is that A proceeds B -
 * this is the equivalent of "contains" in a vanilla Bloom Filter. The
 * "proceeds", or "contains" function is probabalistic in that there is still a
 * possibility this is a false positive (the past is "contained" in the present
 * and future - the past is a "member" of the set of the present, or current
 * value of the clock - so the FPR applies to the "proceeded" relationship).
