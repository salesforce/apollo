  /**
 * This is the <i>front-end</i> for a <i>barrier</i> that can be used as
 * a {@link Guard} in an {@link Alternative}.
 * <p>
 * <H2>Description</H2>
 * An <i>alting</i> barrier is represented by a family of <code>AltingBarrier</code>
 * <i>front-ends</i>.  Each <i>process</i> using the barrier must do so via its
 * own <i>front-end</i>.  A new <i>alting</i> barrier is created by the static
 * {@link #create create} method, which returns an array of <i>front-ends</i>.
 * If new processes need to be enrolled, further <i>front-ends</i> may be made
 * from an existing one (see {@link #expand(int) expand} and
 * {@link #contract(AltingBarrier[]) contract}).
 * A process may temporarilly {@link #resign resign} from a barrier and, later,
 * re-{@link #enroll enroll}.
 * <p>
 * To use this barrier, a process simply includes its given <code>AltingBarrier</code>
 * <i>front-end</i> in a {@link Guard} array associated with an {@link Alternative}.
 * Its index will be selected if and only if all parties (processes) to the barrier
 * similarly select it (using their own <i>front-ends</i>).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If a process wishes to commit to this barrier (i.e. not offer it as a choice
 * in an {@link Alternative}), it may {@link #sync sync} on it.
 * However, if all parties only do this, a <i>non-alting</i> {@link Barrier}
 * would be more efficient.
 * A further shortcut (over using an {@link Alternative}) is provided
 * to {@link #poll(long) poll} this barrier for completion.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * An <code>AltingBarrier</code> <i>front-end</i> may only be used by one process
 * at a time (and this is checked at run-time).
 * A process may communicate a non-resigned <i>front-end</i> to another process;
 * but the receiving process must {@link #mark mark} it before using it and,
 * of course, the sending process must not continue to use it.
 * If a process terminates holding a <i>front-end</i>, it may be recycled
 * for use by another process via {@link #reset reset}.
 * </p>
 * <H3>Priorities</H3>
 * These do not <i>-- and cannot --</i> apply to selection between barriers.
 * The {@link Alternative#priSelect priSelect()} method works locally for
 * the process making the offer.
 * If this were allowed, one process might offer barrier <code>x</code> with higher
 * priority than barrier <code>y</code> ... and another process might offer them
 * with its priorities the other way around.
 * In which case, it would be impossible to resolve a choice in favour of
 * <code>x</code> or <code>y</code> in any way that satisfied the conflicting
 * priorities of both processes.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * However, the {@link Alternative#priSelect priSelect()} method <i>is</i>
 * allowed for choices including barrier guards.  It honours the respective
 * priorities defined between <i>non-barrier</i> guards ... and those
 * between a <i>barrier</i> guard and <i>non-barrier</i> guards (which
 * guarantees, for example, immediate response to a timeout from ever-active
 * barriers).  Relative priorities between <i>barrier</i> guards are inoperative.
 * </p>
 * <H3>Misuse</H3>
 * The implementation defends against misuse, throwing an {@link AltingBarrierError}
 * error when riled.  See the documentation for {@link AltingBarrierError} for
 * circumstances.
 * </p>
 * <H2>Example 0 <i>(a single alting barrier)</i></H2>
 * Here is a simple gadget with two modes of operation, switched by a <i>click</i>
 * event (operated externally by a button in the application below).
 * Initially, it is in <i>individual</i> mode -- represented here by incrementing
 * a number and outputting it (as a <code>String</code> to change the label on
 * its controlling button) as often as it can.
 * Its other mode is <i>group</i>, in which it can only work if all associated
 * gadgets are also in this mode.  Group work consists of a single decrement
 * and output of the number (to its button's label).
 * It performs group work as often as the group will allow (i.e. until it, or
 * one of its partner gadgets, is clicked back to <i>individual</i> mode).

 * Here is code for a system of buttons and gadgets, synchronised by

 *   }
 * 
 * }
 * </PRE>
 * The very simple <i>"group"</i> work in the above example consists of actions
 * performed independently by each gadget (decrementing the number on its
 * button's label).  The (alting) barrier synchronisation ensures that
 * these decrements keep in step with each other.
 * <p>
 * A more interesting gadget would work with other gadgets for <i>group</i> work
 * that really did require them all to be engaged.
 * For example, they resume operation of a machine that would be dangerous if
 * some gadgets (perhaps those responsible for safety aspects) were doing
 * their <i>individual</i> work.
 * </p>
 * <H2>Example 1 <i>(lots of alting barriers)</i></H2>
 * This example derives from a pathological challenge to the management of choice
 * between multiway synchronisations raised by <i>Michael Goldsmith (Formal
 * Systems Europe)</i>.
 * There are three processes (<code>P</code>, <code>Q</code> and <code>R</code>)
 * and theee events (<code>a</code>, <code>b</code> and <code>c</code>).
 * <code>P</code> offers events <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>;
 * <code>Q</code> offers events <code>b</code> and <code>c</code>;
 * and <code>R</code> offers events <code>c</code> and <code>a</code>.
 * If <code>P</code> and <code>Q</code> synchronise on <code>b</code>,
 * they do something (possibly together) then start again.
 * Similarly if <code>Q</code> and <code>R</code> synchronise on <code>c</code>
 * or if <code>R</code> and <code>P</code> synchronise on <code>a</code>.
 * In CSP, the expression is trivial:
 * <PRE>
 *  P = ((a -> P0); P) [] ((b -> P1); P), and where c is not in the alphabet of P
 *  Q = ((b -> Q0); Q) [] ((c -> Q1); Q), and where a is not in the alphabet of Q
 *  R = ((c -> R0); R) [] ((a -> R1); R), and where b is not in the alphabet of R
 *
 *  SYSTEM = (P || Q || R) \ {a, b, c}
 * </PRE>
 * To impact their environment (and avoid <i>divergence</i>), the sub-processes
 * <code>P0</code>, <code>P1</code>, <code>Q0</code>, <code>Q1</code>,
 * <code>R0</code> and <code>R1</code> will engage in external events
 * (i.e. not just <code>a</code>, <code>b</code> or <code>c</code>).
 * Additionally, <code>P1</code> and <code>Q0</code>
 * (triggered by <code>b</code>) may engage in other hidden events,
 * not given in the above.
 * The same for <code>Q1</code> and <code>R0</code>
 * (triggered by <code>c</code>) and for <code>R1</code> and <code>P0</code>
 * (triggered by <code>a</code>).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In our version, there are <code>N</code> processes and events arranged (logically)
 * around a circle.
 * Each process is either <i>off</i> or on <i>standby</i>, switching between
 * these states on random timeouts.
 * Each process is also attached to a personal button that it uses
 * to indicate its state.
 * When <i>off</i>, it colours its button black; when on <i>standby</i>,
 * light gray.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When on <i>standby</i>, each process offers <code>(span+1)</code> events:
 * a timeout, the event with it on the circle and the next <code>(span-1)</code>
 * events going (say) clockwise.
 * It the timeout occurs, it switches to its <i>off</i> state.
 * If one of the events (<code>AltingBarrier</code>) occurs, it must have
 * occured for a consecutive block of <code>span</code> processes (including
 * this one ... somewhere) around the circle.
 * This group now go into a <i>playing</i> state.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Not mentioned before is a <i>rail track</i>, made of channels, running round
 * the circle.
 * When playing, the process furthest uptrack choses a colour and sends this to
 * its partners down the track (to which the mulitway synchronisation ensures
 * this group has exclusive access).
 * Each process in the playing group then flashes its button with that colour
 * a fixed (parametrised) number of times.
 * The rate of flashing is coordinated by the <code>AltingBarrier</code>
 * multiway synchronisation event common to the group --
 * the furthest uptrack process only keeping time for this.
 * After playing, the process switches to its <i>off</i> state.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * [Note: the above <code>SYSTEM</code> has <code>N</code> equal to
 * <code>3</code>, <code>span</code> equal to <code>2</code>, no <i>off</i>
 * state and no timeout on <i>standby</i>.
 * The channels used to flash the buttons are the external events mentioned
 * and the <i>rail track</i> channels are the hidden extras.]
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Here is the code for these processes.
 * As usual, the constructor just saves all parameters:

 * </PRE>
 * 
 * <H3>Other Examples</H3>
 * The <code>alting-barriers</code> directory in <code>jcsp-demos</code>
 * contains other gadgets in a similar vein.
 * 
 * <H4><code>AltingBarrierGadget2</code></H4>
 * These are similar to <code>AltingBarrierGadget1</code>, but sit on
 * a <i>2-way</i> circular railtrack offering to synchronise in the same
 * <code>span</code>-groups.
 * Their difference is the game they play when synchronised:
 * <i>pass-the-parcel</i> up and down their section of track, with
 * the parcel's (rapid) progress indicated by writing on the button labels.
 * These gadgets also enable their buttons when playing and finish their game
 * when any one, or more, of their buttons is clicked -- or they get bored and
 * timeout.
 * 
 * <H4><code>AltingBarrierGadget3</code></H4>
 * Along with their attached buttons, these form a two dimensional structure
 * covering the surface of a <i>torus</i>.
 * The gadgets on the <i>top</i> row are adjacent to the gadgets on
 * the <i>bottom</i> row.
 * The gadgets on the <i>left</i> column are adjacent to the gadgets on
 * the <i>right</i> column.
 * The demonstration program, <code>AltingBarrierGadget3Demo0</code>,
 * asks the user to choose between various shapes and sizes for
 * the synchronisation groups (<i>pluses</i>, <i>crosses</i> and
 * <i>circles</i>) -- but all groups have the same shape and size.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Creation and distribution of the barriers is not done by the demonstration
 * program but, more simply, by the gadgets themselves.
 * Each <code>AltingBarrierGadget3</code> belongs to many synchronisation
 * groups, but has <i>lead</i> responsibility for one.
 * It services the input end of a single channel and is given the (shared)
 * output ends of the service channels to the other gadgets in the group
 * it is leading.
 * <i>[Note: the giver of those output ends is the demonstration program.]</i>
 * It creates the alting barrier (and some other things -- see below) for
 * its lead group.
 * Distribution is by <i>I/O-PAR</i> exchange over their service channels as
 * the gadgets initialise.
 * Each gadget sends the things it made to the gadgets in the group it is
 * leading and receives the same from the leaders of its other synchronisation
 * groups.
 * This is the only use they make of these channels.  
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A synchronised group plays a simple counting game until one of its buttons
 * is clicked or the countdown reaches zero.
 * Termination of the game is, and has to be, simultaneous.
 * This is managed by a <i>shared</i> termination flag, safely operated
 * through <i>phased barrier synchronisation</i> (which lets any process
 * in the group set it in an <i>even phase</i>, with all processes acting
 * on it in the <i>odd</i> phases).
 * Shared label and colour variables (for the group's buttons) are operated
 * similarly.
 * The shared variables are distributed (as fields of a shared object) by
 * the leader gadget, along with the group's <i>alting</i> barrier front-ends,
 * during initialisation.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The group's <code>AltingBarrier</code> is used to separate the phases.
 * <i>Alting</i> capability on this barrier enables rapid response to
 * <i>any</i> button click on the group to end the game.
 * The lead gadget controls timing: it <i>alts</i> between a countdown timeout,
 * its button click and a cancel message from the rest of the group (should
 * any of their buttons be clicked) -- following any of these with the barrier
 * sync, scheduling the next phase.
 * The other gadgets <i>alt</i> between their button click and the barrier:
 * response to a click being the (timeout) cancel message to the leader then
 * wait for the barrier; response to the barrier being the next phase.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The <code>Any2One</code> cancel channel is a mulitplexing relay from
 * the non-lead buttons to the leader gadget.
 * It is constructed by the lead gadget and distributed to its team alongside
 * the shared variables.
 * The cancel channel must be <i>overwriting buffered</i>
 * to avoid deadlock -- the same as the click channels from buttons.
 * The cancel channel must be cleared at the start of each game -- same as
 * the click channels.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <A NAME="user-game"><!-- --></A>
 * <b><i>USER GAME</i></b>: run the demo program on a 30x20 grid (expand to
 * full screen), with circle shapes (say), a radius of 3, off and standBy
 * intervals of 1000 (millisecs), play interval of 10000 (millisecs) and
 * a count interfavl of 200 (millisecs).
 * Your challenge is to zap all the coloured shapes away before any of their
 * counts reach zero and the end of the world happens, <i>:)</i>.
 * How long can you survive?!!
 * </p>
 * 
 * <H4><code>AltingBarrierGadget4</code></H4>
 * These are the same as the previous (<code>AltingBarrierGadget3</code>)
 * gadgets, except that they do not assume that all the synchronisation groups
 * to which they belong have the same shape or size.
 * While they do know the size of the group they lead (from the length of
 * the channel of output ends they are given), that is all they know.
 * In particular, they do not know how many items (barriers etc.) to expect
 * from the leaders of their other groups in the opening exchange.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This is solved by giving each gadget a global barrier on which their
 * parallel outputting processes synchronise when they finish their
 * distribution.
 * After this synchronisation, <i>all</i> exchanges must have finished and
 * they can tell their gadgets to proceed.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The demonstration program for these gadgets just asks for a size for
 * synchronisation groups and allocates (lead) shapes randomly.
 * It could randomise the sizes as well, but the smaller patterns would
 * always emerge dominant in the synchronisations achieved (simply because
 * they require fewer gadgets to be simultaneously on <i>standby</i> --
 * i.e. offering mode) and the consequent games.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b><i>USER GAME</i></b>: same as <a href="#user-game">before</a>,
 * except with a span (rather than radius) of 3.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <H4><code>AltingBarrierGadget5</code></H4>
 * These are the same as <code>AltingBarrierGadget4</code>, except for
 * the technique used to signal the end of the initial exchange of information
 * amongst the synchronisation groups.
 * They use a global <i>alting</i> barrier on which both the outputting
 * and inputting partners in the exchange offer to synchronise -- the former
 * when finished outputting and the latter as an alternative to inputting.
 * This is, perhaps, more elegant than the <i>conventional</i> barrier and channel
 * used by the <code>AltingBarrierGadget4</code> gadgets and exercises
 * the {@link #expand()} and {@link #contract()} methods.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b><i>USER GAME</i></b>: same as <a href="#user-game">before</a>,
 * except with a span (rather than radius) of 3.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <H4><code>AltingBarrierGadget6</code></H4>
 * The unbuffered service channels used by <code>AltingBarrierGadget3</code>,
 * <code>AltingBarrierGadget4</code> and <code>AltingBarrierGadget5</code>
 * (in the opening <i>I/O-PAR</i> exchange of information amongst each
 * playing group) force the leaders to synchronise with each of their
 * team members.
 * This is no problem for <code>AltingBarrierGadget3</code>, since all groups
 * have the same size and it receives as many messages as it sends; knowing
 * how many messages it is sending, it knows how large its reception arrays
 * should be.
 * This is not the case for <code>AltingBarrierGadget4</code> and
 * <code>AltingBarrierGadget5</code>, which must first receive into
 * <i>collection</i> objects that can expand to any size.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <code>AltingBarrierGadget6</code> performs an <i>asynchronous</i> opening
 * exchange of information, using the collection objects directly to buffer
 * the communication messages and no channels.
 * Further, no internal parallelism is needed for this exchange: the gadgets
 * first add all their messages to the collections held by the rest of their
 * team; then, they synchronise on the global barrier (a <i>non-alting</i>
 * one, the same as used by <code>AltingBarrierGadget4</code>s); finally,
 * they extract the information sent by the leaders of the other teams to
 * which they belong.
 * As before, the barrier synchronisation is crucial for the correctness of
 * this exchange, ensuring that all messages are in place before they are
 * gathered.
