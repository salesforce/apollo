 * <P>
 * The only methods provided are to obtain the <i>ends</i> of the channel,

 * Only an appropriate <i>channel-end</i> should be plugged into a process
 * &ndash; not the <i>whole</i> channel.
 * A process may use its external channels in one direction only
 * &ndash; either for <i>writing</i> or <i>reading</i>.
 * </P>
 * <P>Actual channels conforming to this interface are made using the relevant
 * <tt>static</tt> construction methods from {@link Channel}.
 * Channels may be {@link Channel#any2oneInt() <i>synchronising</i>},
 * {@link Channel#any2oneInt(jcsp.util.ints.ChannelDataStoreInt) <i>buffered</i>},
 * {@link Channel#any2oneInt(int) <i>poisonable</i>}

 * <H2>Description</H2>
 * <TT>Any2OneChannelInt</TT> is an interface for an integer channel which
 * is safe for use by many writing processes but only one reader.
 * Writing processes compete with each other to use the channel.
 * Only the reader and one writer will
 * actually be using the channel at any one time.  This is managed by the
 * channel &ndash; user processes just read from or write to it.
 * </P>
 * <P>
 * <I>Please note that this is a safely shared channel and not a message gatherer.
 * Currently, gathering has to be managed by writing an active process.</I>
 * <P>
 * The reading process may {@link Alternative <TT>ALT</TT>} on this channel.
 * The writing process is committed (i.e. it may not back off).
 * </P>
 * <P>
 * The default semantics of the channel is that of CSP &ndash; i.e. it is
 * zero-buffered and fully synchronised.  The reading process must wait
 * for a matching writer and vice-versa.
 * </P>
 * <P>
 * The <tt>static</tt> methods of {@link Channel} construct channels with
 * either the default semantics or with buffering to user-specified capacity
 * and a range of blocking/overwriting policies.
 * Various buffering plugins are given in the <TT>jcsp.util</TT> package, but
 * <I>careful users</I> may write their own.
 * </P>
 * <P>
 * The {@link Channel} methods also provide for the construction of
 * {@link Poisonable} channels and for arrays of channels.
 *
 * <H3><A NAME="Caution">Implementation Note and Caution</H3>
 * <I>Fair</I> servicing of writers to this channel depends on the <I>fair</I>
 * servicing of requests to enter a <TT>synchronized</TT> block (or method) by
 * the underlying Java Virtual Machine (JVM).  Java does not specify how threads
 * waiting to synchronize should be handled.  Currently, Sun's standard JDKs queue
 * these requests - which is <I>fair</I>.  However, there is at least one JVM
 * that puts such competing requests on a stack - which is legal but <I>unfair</I>
 * and can lead to infinite starvation.  This is a problem for <I>any</I> Java system
 * relying on good behaviour from <TT>synchronized</TT>, not just for these
 * <I>any-1</I> channels.
