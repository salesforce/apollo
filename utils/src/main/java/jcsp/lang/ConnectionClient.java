/**
 * <p>This is an interface to be implemented by classes that wish
 * to act as a client to connect to a <code>ConnectionServer</code>.</p>
 *
 * <p>Users of classes implementing this interface should call
 * <code>request(Object)</code> to initiate a conversation and to send some
 * data to the server.  Implementations may decide to return immediately or
 * to wait until the server accepts the connection and then return. The
 * Connection is not guaranteed to be open until a call to <code>reply()</code>
 * has returned.  The <code>reply()</code> method should be called <I>soon</I>
 * after the call to <code>reqeust(Object)</code>. Some computation may be
 * done between the calls but any external process synchronization is
 * potentially hazardous.</p>
 *
 * <p>After calling <code>reply()</code>, clients can check whether
 * the server closed the connection by calling <code>isOpen()</code>.
 * If it returns <code>true</code>, then the connection has been kept
 * open. If the connection has been kept open then the client may assume
 * that a call to <code>request(Object)</code> will not block and that
 * the connection will <I>soon</I> be dealt with by the server.</p>
 *
 * <p>This is an example of typical code structure for using a
 * ConnectionClient:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * //have a variable client of type ConnectionClient
 * do {
 *     client.request(some_data);
 *     some_variable = client.receive();
 * } while (client.isOpen())
 * </pre>

     * <p>Once this method has returned, the client may do some computation but
