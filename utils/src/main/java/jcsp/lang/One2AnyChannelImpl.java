    /**
 * This implements a one-to-any object channel,
 * safe for use by one writer and many readers.
 * <H2>Description</H2>
 * <TT>One2AnyChannel</TT> is an implementation of a channel which is safe
 * for use by many reading processes but only one writer.  Reading processes
 * compete with each other to use the channel.  Only one reader and the writer will
 * actually be using the channel at any one time.  This is taken care of by
 * <TT>One2AnyChannel</TT> -- user processes just read from or write to it.
 * <P>
 * <I>Please note that this is a safely shared channel and not
 * a broadcaster.  Currently, broadcasting has to be managed by
 * writing active processes (see {@link jcsp.plugNplay.DynamicDelta}
 * for an example).</I>
 * <P>
 * All reading processes and the writing process commit to the channel
 * (i.e. may not back off).  This means that the reading processes
 * <I>may not</I> {@link Alternative <TT>ALT</TT>} on this channel.
 * <P>
 * The default semantics of the channel is that of CSP -- i.e. it is
 * zero-buffered and fully synchronised.  A reading process must wait
 * for the matching writer and vice-versa.
 * <P>
 * A factory pattern is used to create channel instances. The <tt>create</tt> methods of {@link Channel}
 * allow creation of channels, arrays of channels and channels with varying semantics such as
 * buffering with a user-defined capacity or overwriting with various policies.
 * Standard examples are given in the <TT>jcsp.util</TT> package, but
 * <I>careful users</I> may write their own.
 *
 * <H3><A NAME="Caution">Implementation Note and Caution</H3>
 * <I>Fair</I> servicing of readers to this channel depends on the <I>fair</I>
 * servicing of requests to enter a <TT>synchronized</TT> block (or method) by
 * the underlying Java Virtual Machine (JVM).  Java does not specify how threads
 * waiting to synchronize should be handled.  Currently, Sun's standard JDKs queue
 * these requests - which is <I>fair</I>.  However, there is at least one JVM
 * that puts such competing requests on a stack - which is legal but <I>unfair</I>
 * and can lead to infinite starvation.  This is a problem for <I>any</I> Java system
 * relying on good behaviour from <TT>synchronized</TT>, not just for these
 * <I>1-any</I> channels.
