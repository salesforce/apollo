 * <H2>Description</H2>
 * <TT>PriParallel</TT> is an extension of the {@link Parallel} class that prioritises
 * the processes given to its control.
 * The ordering of the processes in
 * the array passed to the constructor (or added/inserted later) is significant,
 * with earlier processes having higher priority.  The last process in the
 * array inherits the priority of the constructing process.  That priority may
 * be set explicitly by {@link #setPriority <TT>setPriority</TT>}.
 * <P>
 * <I>Implementation Note</I>: these priorities are currently implemented
 * using the underlying threads priority mechanism.  If there are more
 * priorities required than the maximum allowed for the threadgroup of
 * the spawning process, the higher requested priorities will be truncated
 * to that maximum.  Also, the semantics of priority will be that implemented
 * by the JVM being used.
