  /**
 * This holds the log of spurious wakeups and early timeouts.
 * <H2>Description</H2>
 * The <tt>java.lang.Object.wait</tt> method sometimes returns <i>spuriously</i>
 * - i.e. without being <tt>notify</tt>'d by another thread or <tt>interrupt</tt>ed 
 * or timed-out!  This class is an optional (static) repository holding and reporting
 * counts of any such spurious wakeups.  JCSP handles all spurious wakeups cleanly.
 * <p>
 * Some JVMs also timeout on calls of <tt>wait(timeout)</tt> early.  This class
 * enables the specification of <i>how early</i> will be acceptable to JCSP.
 * <i>``Timeouts''</i> returned earlier than the set threshold are treated as
 * <i>spurious wakeups</i> (i.e. the process is put back to sleep).
 * Provision is also made for counting and reporting the accepted early timeouts.
 * <p>
 * To operate, this logging must first be switched on ({@link #start}). 
 *
