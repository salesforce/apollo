 * <p>Interface for a channel end supporting write filtering operations. A channel end that implements this
 * interface can have instances of the <code>Filter</code> interface installed to apply transformations
 * on data as it is written to the channel.</p>
 *
 * <p>Multiple filters can be installed and referenced by a zero-based index to specify a specific
 * ordering.</p>
 *
 * <p>If multiple filters are installed, they are applied in order of increasing index. For example:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 *   FilteredChannelOutput out = ...;
 *
 *   Filter f1 = ...;
 *   Filter f2 = ...;
 *
 *   out.addWriteFilter (f1, 0);
 *   out.addWriteFilter (f2, 1);
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>The <code>out.write()</code> method will deliver <code>f2.filter (f1.filter (obj))</code> to
 * the reader of the channel where <code>obj</code> is the data value that would have been delivered in
 * the absence of filters.</p>
