This provides classes and interfaces corresponding to the fundamental
primitives of CSP.

<H2>Processes, Networks and Synchronisation</H3>
In JCSP, a <I>process</I> is an instance of a class implementing the
{@link jcsp.lang.CSProcess} interface - its behaviour being determined
by the implementation of its <TT>run()</TT> method.  Processes may be composed
in {@link jcsp.lang.Sequence} or {@link jcsp.lang.Parallel} (or {@link jcsp.lang.PriParallel}),
the result of this composition being another process.  Processes may also be spawned
to run concurrently with the spawning process - see {@link jcsp.lang.ProcessManager}.
A collection of parallel processes is called a <I>network</I>.
<P>
Processes encapsulate both data and algorithms.  Parallel processes interact
<I>either</I> by synchronised communication along {@link jcsp.lang.Channel}s
(the cleanest and simplest way) <I>or</I> by synchronised access to shared
objects.  The latter synchronisation may be achieved through channel signals
or by a range of other JCSP primitives (such as {@link jcsp.lang.Barrier},
{@link jcsp.lang.AltingBarrier},
{@link jcsp.lang.Bucket} or {@link jcsp.lang.Crew}).

<H2>Channels</H3>
Channels come in two varieties: those that carry <TT>Object</TT> references and
those that carry <TT>int</TT>s.  For completeness, JCSP should provide channels
specific to all the Java primitive types.  These could trivially be added but,
so far, do not seem to be needed in practice.
Specialised channels, using Java <i>generics</i>, are easy to add and will be done
soon &ndash; please <A HREF="mailto:jcsp-team@kent.ac.uk">mail us</A> if you have urgent need.

<H3>Channels (from the Point of View of a Process)</H3>
Processes should drive their channels through <I>channel ends</I>:
{@link jcsp.lang.ChannelInput} / {@link jcsp.lang.ChannelOutput} (for <TT>Object</TT> channels)
and {@link jcsp.lang.ChannelInputInt} / {@link jcsp.lang.ChannelOutputInt} (for <TT>int</TT> channels).
To allow <i>choice</i> of receiving input (see next paragraph), processes must drive
their channels through {@link jcsp.lang.AltingChannelInput} / {@link jcsp.lang.AltingChannelInputInt}
(rather than {@link jcsp.lang.ChannelInput} / {@link jcsp.lang.ChannelInputInt}).
<P>
Processes may passively wait for a number of events using {@link jcsp.lang.Alternative}.
These events include <I>channel inputs</I>
({@link jcsp.lang.AltingChannelInput} / {@link jcsp.lang.AltingChannelInputInt}),
<I>channel accepts</I>
({@link jcsp.lang.AltingChannelAccept}),
<i>alting barriers</i> ({@link jcsp.lang.AltingBarrier}),
<I>timeouts</I> ({@link jcsp.lang.CSTimer}) and <I>skips</I> ({@link jcsp.lang.Skip}).
If more than one event is ready, an {@link jcsp.lang.Alternative#select() <I>arbitrary</I>},
{@link jcsp.lang.Alternative#priSelect() <I>prioritised</I>}
or {@link jcsp.lang.Alternative#select() <I>fair</I>} choice can be made between them.
The <I>super-interface</I> for all these ALTable events is {@link jcsp.lang.Guard}.

<H3>Channels (from the Point of View of a Network)</H3>
Actual channels must be constructed by the {@link jcsp.lang.Parallel} network builder
with appropriate <i>channel ends</i> passed to the processes needing them (usually via their constructors).
Four varieties are available for <TT>Object</TT> channels:
{@link jcsp.lang.One2OneChannel}, {@link jcsp.lang.Any2OneChannel},
{@link jcsp.lang.One2AnyChannel} and {@link jcsp.lang.Any2AnyChannel}.
Similarly, four varieties are available for <TT>int</TT> channels:
{@link jcsp.lang.One2OneChannelInt}, {@link jcsp.lang.Any2OneChannelInt},
{@link jcsp.lang.One2AnyChannelInt} and {@link jcsp.lang.Any2AnyChannelInt}.
Please note that the last two in each set are <I>not</I> broadcasting channels
- broadcasting has to be achieved by active processes (e.g. {@link jcsp.plugNplay.Delta}).
Channels are constructed by the <tt>static</tt> manufacturing methods of
the {@link jcsp.lang.Channel} class.
Input and output <i>channel ends</i> are obtained from channels by their <tt>in()</tt> and <tt>out</tt>
methods, respectively.
<P>
Note that the default semantics for all the above channels are zero-buffering and full
synchronisation.  This means that a writer to a channel will wait for a matching reader
<I>and vice-versa</I> - whoever gets to the channel first will wait
for its partner.  Various forms of buffering can be introduced by splicing active
buffer processes into these channels.  However, because this is a common need,
JCSP provides a range of <I>plug-ins</I> that can be used to create channels
with the common varieties of buffering:
{@link jcsp.util.Buffer <I></code>blocking FIFO<code></I>},
{@link jcsp.util.OverWriteOldestBuffer <I></code>overwriting (oldest) FIFO<code></I>},
{@link jcsp.util.OverWritingBuffer <I></code>overwriting (latest) FIFO<code></I>} and
{@link jcsp.util.InfiniteBuffer <I></code>infinite FIFO<code></I>}.
That set of <I>plug-ins</I> is for <TT>Object</TT> channels and comes from
the {@link jcsp.util} package.
A similar set for <TT>int</TT> channels is provided in {@link jcsp.util.ints}.
<P>
It is the network builder's responsibility to decide whether to use <i>1-1</i>,
<i>any-1</i>, <i>1-any</i> or <i>any-any</i> channels and whether to incorporate
buffers in them.
The process designer is not concerned with these decisions - only with whether
the channel is for input or output and what type of information it carries.

<H3>Call Channels</H3>
Call Channels provide a method interface for client-server communication between active
processes, yet their semantics remain those of a synchronising zero-buffered channel.
Without them, we would normally have to set up a pair of channels (giving bi-directional
communication) and use a sequence of channel write(s) and read (at the client end)
matched by a sequence of channel read(s) and write (at the server end).
<P>
The client process sees a server-specific method interface and invokes it in the normal
way - however, the invocation will block until the server chooses to accept the call.
The server sees the {@link jcsp.lang.ChannelAccept} interface - invoking
an {@link jcsp.lang.ChannelAccept#accept <TT>accept</TT>} will block until the client
makes a call.
<P>
The network builder constructs a server-specific actual call channel by sub-classing
from one of 
{@link jcsp.lang.One2OneCallChannel}, {@link jcsp.lang.Any2OneCallChannel},
{@link jcsp.lang.One2AnyCallChannel} and {@link jcsp.lang.Any2AnyCallChannel}.
Precise rules for making this extension are given in their documentation.

<H3>Symmetric Channels</H3>
Thanks to <i>alting barriers</i> ({@link jcsp.lang.AltingBarrier}),
<i>symmetric</i> channels are now available:
{@link jcsp.lang.One2OneChannelSymmetric} and {@link  jcsp.lang.One2OneChannelSymmetricInt}.
These work the same as ordinary channels but, in addition, their <i>output ends</i>
can be used as guards in a choice ({@link jcsp.lang.Alternative}).
It is quite safe for both the sending and receiving process to be alting
on these symmetric channels.
