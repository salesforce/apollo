<p>
This defines filtering channels that can apply transformations to objects
as they are read and/or written.
A completely filtered channel can be created using the <code>FilteredChannel</code>
factory, or a filtered end can be created for an existing channel.
</p>
<p>
Only a <code>PoisonFilter</code> is included in this package.
User-defined filters can be created by implementing the <code>Filter</code>
interface to define the transformation operation to apply on data objects.
